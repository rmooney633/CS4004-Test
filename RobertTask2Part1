Test 1

Original Code

	public class BiggestNumber {

	public static Object displayLargestNumber(double num1, double num2, 
		    double num3)
		    {
		
			double Answer = 0;
		
		        if(num1>=num2 || num1>=num3){
		            Answer = num1;
		        }
		        if(num2>=num1 || num2>=num3){
		            Answer = num2;
		        }
		        if(num3>=num1 || num3>=num2){
		            Answer = num3;
		        }
				return Answer;
		    }
	}


Test Code

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class BiggestNumberTest {

	@Test
	void test() {
		BiggestNumber test = new BiggestNumber();
		double output = (double) test.displayLargestNumber(567, 55.6, 243);
		assertEquals(567, output);
	}

}


Failures:

output: expected: 567	but was: 243


Fixed Code:

public class BiggestNumber {

	public static Object displayLargestNumber(double num1, double num2, 
		    double num3)
		    {
		
			double Answer = 0;
		
		        if(num1>=num2 && num1>=num3){
		            Answer = num1;
		        }
		        if(num2>=num1 && num2>=num3){
		            Answer = num2;
		        }
		        if(num3>=num1 && num3>=num2){
		            Answer = num3;
		        }
				return Answer;
		    }
}


The problem:
In the IF statements, AND was required rather than OR



Test 2

Original Code

public class RockPaperScissors {
    	public static String RockPaperScissorGame(int playerNumber)
    	{
        int programNumber = (int)(Math.random()*3);
        String Answer = null;
        
        if (programNumber == 1) {
            if (playerNumber == 0) {
            	Answer = "The computer is scissor. You are scissor. It is a Draw";
                return Answer;
            }
            if (playerNumber == 1) {
            	Answer = "The computer is scissor. You are rock. You Win";
            	System.out.println(Answer);
            }
            if (playerNumber == 2) {
            	Answer = "The computer is scissor. You are paper. You Lose";
                System.out.println(Answer);

                System.out.println(Answer);
            }
        }
        if (programNumber == 3) {
            if (playerNumber == 0) {
            	Answer = "The computer is paper. You are scissor. You Win";
                System.out.println(Answer);
            }
            if (playerNumber == 1) {
            	Answer = "The computer is paper. You are rock. You Lose";
                System.out.println(Answer);
            }
            if (playerNumber == 2) {
            	Answer = "The computer is paper. You are paper. It is a Draw";
                System.out.println(Answer);
            }
        } else {
            return "Enter either 0,1,2";
        }
		return Answer;
    	}
}


Test Code
	
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class RockPaperScissorsTest {

	@Test
	void test() {
		RockPaperScissors test = new RockPaperScissors();
		String output = test.RockPaperScissorGame(2);
		assertEquals("The computer is paper. You are paper. It is a Draw" , output);
	}

	}


Failures:
Answer: expected: "The computer is paper. You are paper. It is a Draw"	but was: "Enter either 0,1,2"


Fixed Code:

public class RockPaperScissors {
    	public static String RockPaperScissorGame(int playerNumber)
    	{
        int programNumber = (int)(Math.random()*3);
        String Answer = null;
        
        if (programNumber == 0) {
            if (playerNumber == 0) {

        } else {
            return "Enter either 0,1,2";
        }
		return Answer;
    	}
}


The Problem:
The Math.random output starts at 0, but the code presumed it started at 1



Test 3

Original Code

public class NumberSquared {

	public int squared(int x) {
		return sqrt(x);
	}

	private int sqrt(int x) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return x;
	}
	
}


Test Code

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class NumberSquaredTest {

	@Test
	void test() {
		NumberSquared test = new NumberSquared();
		int output = test.squared(100);
		assertEquals(10000, output);
	}

}


Failures:
output: expected: 10000		but was: 10


Fixed Code:

public class NumberSquared {

	public int squared(int x) {
		return x*x;
	}

}


The Problem:
The original code was finding the square root rather than the square of the number



Test 4

Original Code

public class RhombusArea {

	public static double areaOfRhombus(double diameter1, double diameter2) {
		
		double Area = 1/2 * diameter1 * diameter2;
		
		return Area;
		}
	
}


Test Code

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class RhombusAreaTest {

	@Test
	void test() {
		RhombusArea test = new RhombusArea();
		double output = test.areaOfRhombus(20, 18);
		assertEquals(180, output);
	}

}


Failures:
output: expected: 180		but was: 0


Fixed Code:

public class RhombusArea {

	public static double areaOfRhombus(double diameter1, double diameter2) {
		
		double Area = 0.5 * diameter1 * diameter2;
		
		return Area;
		}
	
}


The Problem:
The original code was displaying a half as "1/2" but this meants that the calculation was incorrect
